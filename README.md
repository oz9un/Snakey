# Snakey :snake:

Yeah, as simple as it sounds.

**But:**
- It is responsive! (Bootstrap 4).
- Pure JS/CSS/HTML
- And... I think it's cool.

## How to Play :video_game:

1. Go to https://oz9un.github.io/snakey/snakey/
2. Press space.
3. Enjoy! (No, I am not sure about that much.)

  
## Contributing & TODO's :books:

Contributions are always welcome!

_TODO:_ :sweat_drops:

**1. Adding some other options for players (to the score column):**
- [ ]  Amount of speed boost for every apple eaten.
- [ ]  Adding borders to squares on game screen.

**2. UI:**
- [ ]  Making snake and apples look more fancy.

**3. Game mechanics:**
- [ ]  Add some poisonous apples (Maybe obstructs the field of view).
- [ ]  Add some golden apples (Maybe makes snake shorter).
- [ ]  Add some obstacles to game screen (Maybe with anoter mod).
